Name, Field and Method resolution

The goals of resolution are:
1) to be able to prefix all instance methods with "this." - if not done already
2) to be able to prefix all instance fields with "this." - if not done already
3) check access of the outer scope
4) put full path name for static access to methods
5) put full path name for static access to fields

Here is the list of scopes in the order of their precedence (and how the elements are resolved):
- VariableScope (eager) <=> BlockScope
- ParemeterScope (eager)
- TypeScope (eager)

- ParentTypeScope (lazy)
- ImportScope (lazy)
- FullyQualifiedScope (lazy)
