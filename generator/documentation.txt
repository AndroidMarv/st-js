Name, Field and Method resolution

The goals of resolution are:
1) to be able to prefix all instance methods with "this." - if not done already
2) to be able to prefix all instance fields with "this." - if not done already
3) check access of the outer scope
4) put full path name for static access to methods
5) put full path name for static access to fields
