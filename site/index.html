<h1>Strongly-Typed JavaScript (STJS)</h1>
<p>
STJS is an open source (Apache 2.0 licensed) JavaScript code generator
from a Java source. It is built as a Maven plugin that can be executed after the compilation of your Java code.
</p>

<h2>Why we built it</h2>
<p>
Dynamically typed languages are good for small to medium projects.
But when the size of the project grows and handled data becomes complex
a strongly typed language gives you an extra guarantee that your
changes won&#8217;t break your code.
</p>
<p>
 The current trend is to build very rich web interfaces.
The problem is that the only option all the browsers offer is JavaScript, that is dynamically typed language.
Even if the support from IDEs and browsers keeps growing, you'll find out pretty soon that a JavaScript line of code
gets quite expensive in a big (2000+ JavaScript LOC) project.
</p>
<p>If you landed to our project&#8217;s page, it&#8217;s almost sure you already
have experience with GWT or at least you heard about it.
Even though as a Java developer we are naturally attracted by their
philosophy, it bothered us that their solution is too intrusive:
it imposes you a new framework, new tools, when we were only looking
for something that can add a strongly typed dimension to our JavaScript
code.
</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>An example</h1>
<p>Here is an example of a code written in Java and the corresponding generated
JavaScript.
The Java code may seem a bit longer and possibly more complicated at a
first glance, but it provides you with all the advantages of a typed
language, while preserving as much as possible the resemblance to the
javascript style of programming. The visual resemblance is crucial
here since it allows for faster learning and easier transition. This
visual resemblance maintained throughout the library design
</p>

<div class="code">
  <div class="left">
  <pre>$("#form").submit(new EventHandler() {
  <span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">void</span> onEvent(Event ev, <span class="key">final</span> HTMLElement THIS) {
    StockData stockData =
          that.updateStock($("#newStock").val());
    $(that.row(stockData)).appendTo("table tbody");
    that.stocks.push(stockData.stock);
    }
  });
  </pre>
  </div>
  <div class="right">
  <pre>$("#form").submit(<span class="key">function</span>(ev) {

  <span class="key">var</span> stockData =
          that.updateStock($("#newStock").val());
  $(that.row(stockData)).appendTo("table tbody");
  that.stocks.push(stockData.stock);

});
    </pre>
    </div>
    <div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>How does it work</h1>
<p>STJS does not try to hide from you how JavaScript works.
STJS addresses Java developers that are comfortable with a regular
JavaScript way of building application usually using a component
library (jQuery or others).
We don&#8217;t believe in generated JavaScript that is unreadable and
impossible to debug.
</p>
<p>
So we limited STJS to only generate JavaScript from a Java code that is as close as possible to the original code.
We&#8217;d like to believe that the generated JavaScript code is as we&#8217;d of write it ourselves.
</p>
<p>The only dependency STJS requires at runtime is a small JavaScript library
(that basically provides the function to simulate inheritance in
JavaScript). That&#8217;s it!
STJS imposes no java dependency, no visual component, no AJAX framework.
You can feel free to use the JavaScript libraries and components you
like.
We&#8217;d like to believe that if one day you&#8217;ll stop using STJS (!?), you
just take the generated JavaScript code and continue building your
project.</p>

<p>
The Java code you write (with the purpose to generate
JavaScript) will not be executed as such. You can only use in this code
the Java classes that have their JavaScript counterpart when you
launch it in your browser. So you CANNOT use typical Java classes like
Java util or other JDK packages.

Please note that you need at least <b>Java 6</b> to have ST-JS compiling your projects.
</p>
<p>
If we managed to convince you, please continue further for a few
minutes tutorial.
</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>Other JavaScript constructions</h1>
<p>
The problem with having JavaScript code generated from Java is that
Java is less rich than JavaScript. There are JavaScript constructions
that do not have
their corresponding in Java (or they are different) like object (map)
constructors, array constructors, inline functions.
We tried to provide constructions that may look unusual for a Java
developer but somehow familiar to a JavaScript developer.
</p>

<h2>Map / Object</h2>
<p>In JavaScript as an object may have dynamic properties it can be used also as a map.</p>
In Java we&#8217;d prefer the typed version.
<div class="code">
<div class="left">
<pre>StockData stock = <span class="key">new</span> StockData() {{
   last=10.0;
   close = 2.0;
   stock = "ABC";
}};
</pre>
</div>

<div class="right">
<pre><span class="key">var</span> stock = {
  &#8220;last&#8221;:10,
  &#8220;close&#8221; : 2,
  &#8220;stock&#8221;:&#8221;ABC&#8221;
};
</pre>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<br>
But if you prefer the dynamic (map-like version) you can do, we created a class <b>Map</b> that provides the same methods and access mode as the JavaScript counterpart.

<div class="code">
<div class="left">
<pre>Map&lt;String, Object&gt; stock = $map(
  "last", 2,
  "close", 3,
  "stock", "ABC"
);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="right">
<pre><span class="key">var</span> stock = {
  &#8220;last&#8221;:10,
  &#8220;close&#8221; : 2,
  &#8220;stock&#8221;:&#8221;ABC&#8221;
};
</pre>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<br>
Both codes will generate the same JavaScript!

<br>To access a map element:
<div class="code">
<div class="left">
<pre>Double value = map.$get("key");
map.$set("key", 4);
map.$delete("key");
</pre>
</div>
<div class="right">
<pre><span class="key">var</span> value = map["key"];
map["key"] = 4;
delete map["key"];
</pre>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<h2>Array</h2>
<p>The array in JavaScript has looks a lot like a List in Java, but the
access to its elements is done more like a Java array. So we provided a
class <b>Array</b>
that offers the same methods as the JavaScript counterpart. as the
bracket ([]) construction can only be used in Java with a regular
array, we added $get/$set methods
that will generate the expected code in JavaScript</p>
Here is an example

<div class="code">
<div class="left">
<pre>Array&lt;Integer&gt; array = $array(1, 5, 10);
Integer value = array.$get(2);
array.$set(2, 4);
</pre>
</div>
<div class="right">
<pre><span class="key">var</span> array = [1, 5, 10];
<span class="key">var</span> value = array[2];
array[2] = 4;
</pre>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<h2>Inheritance</h2>
<p>The class inheritance is a common construction in Java, but less common in JavaScript. We simulate the inheritance in JavaScript by using the prototypes.
With this type of inheritance, we simulate instance and static fields and methods. We currently don't support private, protected and final modifiers.
</p>

<p>Here is an example</p>

<div class="code">
<div class="left">
<pre>
<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">class</span> Child <span class="key">extends</span> Parent {
	<span class="key">public</span> Child(String test) {
		<span class="key">super</span>(test);
	}


	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">static</span> <span class="key">int</span> staticField = 1;
	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">int</span> instanceField = 2;

	@Override
	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">void</span> instanceMethod(String n) {
		<span class="key">super</span>.instanceMethod(n + "-");
	}

	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">static</span> <span class="key">void</span> staticMethod() {
		staticField += 1;
	}
}
</pre>
</div>
<div class="right">
<pre>

Child = <span class="key">function</span>(test) {
    <span class="key">this</span>._super(<span class="key">null</span>, test);
}
stjs.extend(Child, Parent);

Child.staticField = 1;
Child.<span class="key">prototype</span>.instanceField = 2;


Child.<span class="key">prototype</span>.instanceMethod = <span class="key">function</span>(n) {
     <span class="key">this</span>._super("instanceMethod", n + "-");
}

Child.staticMethod = <span class="key">function</span>() {
    Child.staticField += 1;
}
</pre>
</div>
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
</div>

<h2>Comparison</h2>
<p>The comparison of objects or primitives is slightly different between Java and Javscript. For example <i>equals</i> method does not exist in JavaScript (and there is no way to influence how egality operators behave in JavaScript).<br/>
Conversely the triple "=" (===) does not exist in Java. And the "==" sign has a slighty different meaning: in JavaScript it may be accompanied by a type conversion!<br/>
To have a predictable behaviour of the generated JavaScript, the <i>equals</i> method is generated as-is. The equals method was added to all primitive types wrappers in JavaScript. More
all generated classes will have an equals method defined in their hierarchy.
The "==" sign is left untouched as there is basically no automatic type conversion involved (because the initial Java code wouldn't allow it).
</p>

<h2>AJAX/JSON</h2>
<p>When you transfer objects between the server and the client, your Data Transfer Objects are usually serialized on the server side (using Gson, Jackson or other library)
and deserialized on the browser usualy using JavaScript <i>eval</i> function (or safer equivalents). The problem with this approach is that all the type information
is lost, because what you'll get will be regular objects (built with {}) without any type conversion for dates or enums or your own types. So you'll be unable to use correctly your
data model inside your JavaScript.</p>
<p>STJS comes with a "type-safe" JSON parser, that will use the type definition stored with the class during the JavaScript generation to re-create back
the serialized object hierarchy. Here is how to use it:
</p>

<div class="code short">
<pre>
<span class="key">import</span> <span class="key">static</span> org.stjs.javascript.Global.stjs;

<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">class</span> Bean{
	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">enum</span> MyEnum {a,b,c};

	<span class="key">public</span> Date date;
	<span class="key">public</span> MyEnum enum;

	<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">void</span> method(){
	}
}

...
Bean b = stjs.parseJSON("{\"date\":\"2011-11-10 10:20:22\", \"enum\":\"a\"}", Bean.class);
</pre>
</div>

<h2>jQuery</h2>
<p>As the first projects where we wanted to use STJS uses jQuery, we had to include right in our first support for this JavaScript library</p>
<p>jQuery has an interesting plugin design: each plugin adds some methods to the jQuery element wrapper. In order to have this behavior in Java
we propose one interface for the jQuery core (<b>org.stjs.javascript.jquery.JQueryCore</b>) and one per plugin (ex: <b>org.stjs.javascript.jquery.plugins.Accordion</b>)
</p>
<div class="code short">
<pre>
<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">interface</span> Accordion&lt;FullJQuery <span class="key">extends</span> JQueryCore&lt;?&gt;&gt; {
	<span class="key">public</span> FullJQuery accordion();

	<span class="key">public</span> FullJQuery accordion(AccordionOptions&lt;FullJQuery&gt; options);
...
</pre>
</div>
<p>
To be able to use jQuery's methods chain (ex. <i>$(".css").accordion().show()</i>), all the plugin methods return a <b>FullJQuery</b> type the is received as generic parameter by the class.
This type will give access to all the methods jQuery and the desired plugins offer. We propose already an interface that combine jQuery core and all the UI plugins:
<b>JQueryAndPlugins</b>. This interface is used when you want to extend it with other plugins (use <b>org.stjs.javascript.jquery.JQuery</b> if you don't plan to other other jQuery plugins).
 But if you want to add your own plugin, create the plugin's interface (like Accordion) and create your own interface that will combine your
plugin's interface and the <b>JQueryAndPlugins</b> interface.
</p>

<div class="code short">
<pre>
<span class="key">public</span> <span class="key">interface</span> MyJQueryLib&lt;FullJQuery <span class="key">extends</span> MyJQueryLib&lt;?&gt;&gt;
	<span class="key">extends</span> MyPlugin&lt;FullJQuery&gt;,
	JQueryAndPlugins&lt;FullJQuery&gt;{
}
</pre>
</div>


<h2>Global Objects</h2>
<p>In JavaScript several objects are accessible as global objects, like <i>window, $</i> (for jQuery). To simulate this in Java we added all these objects
as static fields in the <i>Global</i> object or <i>GlobalJQuery</i> object.
We preferred not to add all the fields and methods of the <i>window</i> object - that in JavaScript are directly accessible. Please use the <i>window</i> object to access them.
</p>

<div class="code short">
<pre>
<span class="key">import</span> <span class="key">static</span> org.stjs.javascript.Global.window;
<span class="key">import</span> <span class="key">static</span> org.stjs.javascript.jquery.GlobalJQuery.$;
</pre>
</div>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>A web page</h1>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;script src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/generated-js/stjs.js"
      type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
  &lt;script src="${pageContext.request.contextPath}/generated-js/StockApplication.js"
      type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

</pre>
</div>
<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>Modules</h1>
<p>
STJS has mainly three modules each of which is used in different phases of your development. As you'll remark we used the property
<b>stjs.version</b> to specify the version of STJS to use (the modules are released together).
</p>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>
&lt;properties&gt;
  &lt;stjs.version&gt;1.1.4&lt;/stjs.version&gt;
&lt;/properties&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p><b>The current STJS version is 1.3.1</b></p>

<h2>The generator</h2>
<p>This is a maven plugin that takes the sources of your project that
you indicate and generate the corresponding javascript files in the
target folder
</p>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>
&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;maven-plugin&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${stjs.version}&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;executions&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;main&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
        &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
    &lt;!-- if you use the test helper --&gt;
    &lt;execution&gt;
      &lt;id&gt;test&lt;/id&gt;
      &lt;goals&gt;
        &lt;goal&gt;generate-test&lt;/goal&gt;
      &lt;/goals&gt;
    &lt;/execution&gt;
  &lt;/executions&gt;
  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;rootPackage&gt;auto&lt;/rootPackage&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<h2>The JavaScript library</h2>
<p>The JavaScript library (js-lib) is a library that you need as
dependency for the Java code (that will be transformed in JavaScript)
you write.
The purpose of this library is to offer bridges to all the JavaScript
objects defined by the browsers.
</p>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;js-lib&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${stjs.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
As a convenience we added as well
a bridge for the jQuery library and jQuery UI plugins. </p>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;jquery&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${stjs.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
</div>

 <p> If in your code you&#8217;d like to use
other JavaScript libraries not already provided by js-lib, you should
build bridges for them following our model.
</p>

<p>
If you'd like to share objects between the client and the server, on the server side you should add the following dependency:
</p>
<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${stjs.version}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
</div>
<p>
This dependency allows you to create maps and arrays and to serialize them (as JSON for example).
</p>

<h2>The test helper</h2>
<p>This modules can be used for your unit tests.
You&#8217;ll be able to write unit tests also in Java.
When executed, the unit tests Java code will be converted to JavaScript
and together with the JavaScript code generated from the tested classes
will be executed in a browser via the our internal JUnit test driver.</a> </p>

<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>
&lt;dependency&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;test-helper&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;${stjs.version}&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;scope&gt;test&lt;/scope&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>Maven</h1>

<h2>Repository</h2>
<p>The artifacts are deployed to the central Maven repository.</p>



<h2>Maven configuration for auto-generation in Eclipse</h2>
<p>If you use Eclipse you can take advantage of the Maven / Eclipse integration.
The JavaScript code is generated each time the corresponding Java class is modified and saved.
This way any modification you bring to your code will be instantly observed on the browser!
Note: you need the at least the 1.0 version of the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/M2E_updatesite_and_gittags" target="_blank">Eclipse plugin for Maven</a>.
</p>

<div class="xmlcode">
<pre>&lt;plugin&gt;
  &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.m2e&lt;/groupId&gt;
  &lt;artifactId&gt;lifecycle-mapping&lt;/artifactId&gt;
  &lt;version&gt;1.0.0&lt;/version&gt;
  &lt;configuration&gt;
    &lt;lifecycleMappingMetadata&gt;
      &lt;pluginExecutions&gt;
        &lt;pluginExecution&gt;
          &lt;pluginExecutionFilter&gt;
            &lt;groupId&gt;org.st-js&lt;/groupId&gt;
            &lt;artifactId&gt;
              maven-plugin
            &lt;/artifactId&gt;
            &lt;versionRange&gt;
              [${stjs.version},)
            &lt;/versionRange&gt;
            &lt;goals&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;generate&lt;/goal&gt;
              &lt;!-- if you use the test helper --&gt;
              &lt;goal&gt;generate-test&lt;/goal&gt;
            &lt;/goals&gt;
          &lt;/pluginExecutionFilter&gt;
          &lt;action&gt;
             &lt;execute /&gt;
          &lt;/action&gt;
        &lt;/pluginExecution&gt;
      &lt;/pluginExecutions&gt;
    &lt;/lifecycleMappingMetadata&gt;
  &lt;/configuration&gt;
&lt;/plugin&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>What you cannot do in STJS</h1>
<p>Even though JavaScript looks to be more flexible than Java, there are things that you can do in Java but you cannot do (at least directly) in JavaScript.
Of course, during the JavaScript generation, we could've add some JavaScript constructions to go around these limitations. But again our philosophy is to alter
as little as possible the Java code during the transformation. That's why we prefer to generate errors and to ask the user to find a compatible alternative.
So here is the list (that keeps growing - unfortunately):
<ul>
<li>you cannot have two methods with the same name (overloading is not possible - overriding is)</li>
<li>you cannot have a method and a field with the same name within the class and its parents!</li>
<li>you cannot have more than one constructor</li>
<li>you cannot use as field or method name JavaScript keywords (that are not Java keywords) like: function, prototype, var</li>
<li>you can only have one form of variable arguments method: one argument only that should be called "arguments" (like the variable available in each JavaScript function)</li>
<li>you cannot initialize inline the instance fields - with the exception of primitive types (and their wrappers) and String</li>
<li>you cannot use Java arrays (for example String[]) - they are not compatible with the JavaScript arrays as they don't have the methods like push, slice, etc.
More, the iteration in Java is done on values (<i>for(String s : array)</i>) while the iteration in JavaScript is done on indexes (<i>for(var idx : array)</i>). Please use the org.stjs.javascript.Array instead.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
In all these cases the alternative is prety simple and it doesn't require you to weird workarounds.
</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>STJS bridge libraries</h1>
<p>
As specified before, STJS is NOT a web framework, so no visual components or other components come with STJS. So you should rely on existing components coming
with different JavaScript frameworks like jQuery, DOJO, etc. There are basically two ways to combine the STJS-generated code depending on were do you
want to make the integration:
<ol>
<li>in Javacript - by using both the components and the STJS generated code</li>
<li>in Java - by building a Java bridge to the component libraries</li>
</ol>
</p>
<p>
We believe the second option brings you the best of both worlds. In fact STJS already provides bridges to the DOM object, jQuery and jQuery UI plugins.
The bridge is composed mostly of Java interfaces that have the same name as their JavaScript counterpart. Sometimes you may also need to provide global
objects or functions (that will be implemented as static fields or methods of the object). In the case of a static method, the method should throw
UnsupportedOperationException - to indicate it's a method to be used in the JavaScript code (not in some server-side Java code).
</p>

<p>
One interesting feature of the bridges is that they are not submitted to the same list of constrains as the regular STJS Java code. This means that
you can overload methods in order to provide more clarity to the user. A good example is the way plugins are built in jQuery where the same function (usually the plugin's name)
has many different usages: activate the plugin, change an option, get a state value, call a method, etc.
</p>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------  -->
<h1>Testing</h1>

<p>To take even more advantage of the strongly-typed code, we added a <a href="http://junit.sourceforge.net/javadoc/org/junit/runner/Runner.html" target="_blank">JUnit runner</a> that
allow you to execute the generated JavaScript (for both the main code and the unit test) in a browser and display back the assert errors as any JUnit test.
</p>
<p>
The test driver is somehow inspired by Selenium and JSTestDriver, but it aims to be lighter and easier to use. For the moment the driver does not handle
AJAX callbacks (so you have to mock your server's response).<br/>
But it comes with an integration with the <a href="https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax">Mockjax</a> plugin that mocks jQuery AJAX calls.
Have a look on the <a href="reference.html">documentation</a> page for more details.
</p>

<p>Here is an example (taken from Mockjax site and re-wrote with STJS):</p>

<div class="code short">
